# SQL To LINQ

This is an updated version (to .NET 5) of my old project that was designed to help beginners to learn LINQ (Query syntax & Method syntax) and [T-]SQL at the same time.

The domain (Bike Stores), database, and most of the SQL queries of this project are taken from [sqlservertutorial.net](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database).

Please execute `Create BikeStores Database.sql` and `Load Sample Data.sql` TSQL Scripts from `Database` directory or just restore `BikeStores.bak` from `Database/BackUp` directory Before running the project.
